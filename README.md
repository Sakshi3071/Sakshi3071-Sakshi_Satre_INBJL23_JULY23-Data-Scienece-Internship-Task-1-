# Task-1 : Implement a Machine Learning Model For Classification Problem
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on heart disease classification. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can classify whether a person has heart disease based on various medical indicators and features.

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of patient data, including attributes like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health factors. We employ state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques to build accurate classifiers and make informed predictions.
