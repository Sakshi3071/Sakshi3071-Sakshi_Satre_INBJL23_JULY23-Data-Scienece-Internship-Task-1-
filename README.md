# Task-1 : Implement a Machine Learning Model For Classification Problem
This file contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on heart disease classification. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can classify whether a person has heart disease based on various medical indicators and features.
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of patient data, including attributes like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health factors. We employ state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques to build accurate classifiers and make informed predictions.

# Task 2 : Implement a Machine Learning Model for Regression Problem
This file contains code and documentation for a regression project focused on predicting PM2.5 air pollution levels. The project aims to build and evaluate regression models to predict PM2.5 concentrations based on various features related to weather conditions and other factors.

# Major Project : Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation for E-commerce platform
This file contains our predictive analysis and customer segmentation project for an E-Commerce platform. This project aims to answer a fundamental question: "Can we predict the annual spending of a customer on an e-commerce platform based on their behavior and demographics?" We also explore how we can segment customers effectively for targeted marketing and personalized user experiences
